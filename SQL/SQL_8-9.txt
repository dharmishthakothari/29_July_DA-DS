DQL - select - filter

eg. fetch records who got more 50000
    Displaty name of employees who joins in May month 
    Dsiplay details of employees whose salary is in range of 20000 to 50000
    Display the emp_name,emp_hiredate,salary who lives in ahmedabad,baroda
    Display the details of employees whose name starts with 's'
    Display the details of employees whose name is 6 character long 
	

select - doesn't affect your data 
 clauses - where 
		and - more then one condition
		or - more then one condition 
		between and - range
		in - within that perticula names 
		like - string/varchar  
		
		Operators - >,<,>=,<= 
		is NULL - 

like - meta characters % - for multiple charancter 
_  - for single character

 - order by - asecending order 
 - agregate functionn  - max,sum,min,avg ,count
- joins 

-- Dsiplay sum of salary department wise\
-- Dsiplay maximum salary in each deparment
- Counter no of employees in each deparment 


Aggregate functions

SELECT MIN(column_name)  FROM table_name WHERE condition;

SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;


The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of employees in each department".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.



The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.


SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name  WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s);




SELECT column_name(s)  FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


LEFT Join

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), even if there are no matches in the right table (table2).


Right Join

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), even if there are no matches in the left table (table1).

Full Join

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

- joins when you want to fetch records from 2/more tables then you join , 
	it is based on commann field
- group by fetch the recored accouding to perticular filed like deparment wise / customer wise reoccrd/product wise
- agreegate function - max,min,sum,count,avg
- having 
	when i want put the condition based on grouping

- limit 

select cust_name , city , email,order_date , status from customers ,orders
where customers.cust_id=orders.cust_id 
and month(order_date)=8 and year(order_date)=2024
